# 🚀 DSAFlow

**Automatic DSA Practice Tracker, Revision Engine & Developer Productivity Tool**

DSAFlow is a **full-stack developer productivity platform** that automatically tracks your Data Structures & Algorithms practice directly from your coding environment and transforms it into a **learning analytics system with spaced repetition, streak tracking, and real-time insights**.

Instead of manually maintaining logs or spreadsheets, **DSAFlow turns the simple act of saving a solution file into structured learning data.**

# 🧠 Overview

DSAFlow is designed for developers and students preparing for coding interviews or competitive programming.

It connects **VS Code → Backend → Database → Dashboard** to automatically track problems solved and schedule revision sessions using **spaced repetition**.

The system provides:

* 🕵️ Automatic logging of solved problems
* 📊 Real-time analytics
* 💡 Topic mastery insights
* ⏰ Revision reminders
* 🏎️ Learning velocity metrics

# ✨ Key Features

### ⚡ Automatic Problem Tracking
The VS Code extension detects when you create a new solution file and logs the problem automatically.

Example:
```
Arrays/two_sum.cpp
```
Automatically extracts:
- **Topic**: Arrays
- **Problem**: two_sum
- **Language**: C++

### 🔁 Spaced Repetition Revision System
DSAFlow schedules problem reviews using scientifically-backed intervals:
- 1 day
- 3 days
- 7 days
- 14 days
- 30 days

This helps reinforce long-term retention of complex algorithms.

### 🔥 Streak Tracking
Maintains daily practice streaks to keep you motivated.
Example:
- 🔥 7 Day Streak
- 🏆 Longest Streak: 15

### 📊 Real-Time Dashboard
The dashboard updates instantly using **Supabase Realtime WebSockets**.
Visual analytics include:
- Activity Heatmap
- Topic Mastery Chart (Progress breakdown)
- Difficulty Distribution (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Revision Queue (Priority items)
- Learning Velocity (Solves per day)

### 🤖 Intelligent Technical Review
Each solved problem can be analyzed using **Google Gemini** for instant feedback.
Analysis includes:
- Time complexity (Big O)
- Space complexity
- Potential edge cases
- Actionable optimization suggestions

# 🔄 Data Flow

1. **User creates solution file** in VS Code.
2. **VS Code Extension checks folder approval**, then detects the file and extracts title/topic.
3. **Metadata inferred** from file path, filename, and optional problem URL.
4. **POST request to API** with secure token.
5. **Supabase database stores record** and updates user stats.
6. **Realtime event triggers dashboard update** via WebSockets.
